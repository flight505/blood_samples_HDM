# Blood Sample Analysis Application

## Description

This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed for analyzing blood sample data, particularly focusing on detecting and visualizing cycles of specific components within the samples. It leverages Python's powerful libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for interactive charting. The application provides functionalities for:

* Authenticating users to ensure secure access.
* Loading and preprocessing blood sample data from CSV files.
* Allowing users to select specific patients, components, and thresholds to analyze.
* Identifying cycles in the component levels based on user-defined criteria.
* Visualizing the data and identified cycles through component plots and radar charts.
* Displaying statistics about the cycles detected for individual patients and across all patients.

## Use Case

This application is particularly useful for researchers and healthcare professionals who need to analyze patterns in blood sample data over time. It can help in identifying trends, anomalies, or specific cycles of components within the blood samples, which could be crucial for diagnosing conditions, monitoring patient health, or conducting medical research.
